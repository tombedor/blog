Choosing Programming Languages in the Age of AI: Why Static Typing Wins
Outline
Introduction

Hook: AI makes different kinds of mistakes than humans
Thesis: Strong typing + modern tooling = better AI coding outcomes
Why this matters now

The Traditional Trade-off (Now Obsolete)
[DIAGRAM: Before/After comparison]

Before AI: Dynamic typing = faster iteration, less boilerplate
With AI: Boilerplate cost → zero
The cost-benefit calculation has flipped

Case Study: Python vs Rust
Python's AI Pitfalls

Type confusion bugs AI commonly makes
Runtime errors that slip through
Examples of subtle bugs that pass code review

Rust's AI Advantages

Compiler as AI error-checker
The self-correcting loop in action
Concrete example: same task, different outcomes

[DIAGRAM: Self-correcting loop flowchart]

AI writes code → Compiler catches error → AI fixes → Success
vs. AI writes code → Runs → Runtime error → Debug cycle → Confusion

Why This Matters Beyond Types
Modern Dev Tools Amplify the Effect

LSP/IDE integration catches AI mistakes in real-time
Build systems prevent configuration drift
Linters enforce consistency AI naturally lacks

The Responsibility Shift

Less human vigilance required
Compiler becomes AI's pair programmer
You review logic, not syntax/types

[DIAGRAM: Responsibility allocation]

Human: High-level logic, architecture
AI: Implementation, boilerplate
Compiler/Tools: Correctness, consistency

Practical Implications

When to choose static over dynamic
Exceptions where dynamic still wins
Migration considerations

Conclusion

Static typing is AI's guardrails
The future: tooling-first language selection
Call to action: rethink your stack

Each should be simple, visual, punchy (like your floor/ceiling raiser post)
Focus on showing the shift or difference, not explaining complexity
